## First Code Jam

#### Good luck!

Most people agree that the code generator is good, so we'll do it.
I have some things to tell you, and if you have other ideas or concerns please tell me

`writer.py`: the main alg file, contains a writer class which contains a run function, (Maybe some error classes).

Each person works with a following things, which github will merge them into the main file later. I'll explain how to code

for the following files make them simple: just basic things that beginners will use

`builtin_funcs`:  where contains bunch of built-in functions, like print(), sum(), min(), max(), etc. 

`operator`:  where contains bunch of operators, such as +-*/, ><>=<=, and or, ets.

`variable`:  where you/users can assign variables with basic functions, and store them as a dictionary of {name: value}

If there is anything else, tell me I'll add to it ðŸ˜€ 
Else we will go with these things from Aug.1 or later

I will first program on the main class first, where you can all pull them from github
Any questions/concerns/details/ideas please tell me!
